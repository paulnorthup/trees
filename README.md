 This will get a static site up and running and provide a basic framework from which to move forward.

##Getting Started

####Install your prerequisites!
Make sure you have node and gulp installed:

`brew install npm`

####Install your dependencies!

`npm install`

`bower install`

`gem install sass slim` *Without the `slim` gem unhandled errors abound*

####Go nuts!
Run `gulp` to get a server going with browser-sync reloading.

Edit in `lib` and let the `dist` build itself as you go. Happy prototyping.
